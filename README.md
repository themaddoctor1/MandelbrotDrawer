# MandelbrotDrawer
The Mandelbrot set is a series of complex numbers c, which when used in the series z' = z^2 + c, where z' is the number after z, and the first term is zero, converges.

When the set is plotted based on the convergence or divergence using values of c, the result is a very interesting fractal which is in some places self-repeating.
